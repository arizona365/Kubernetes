CLUSTER IP AND NODE IP
NODE IP = NODE PORT AND LOAD BALANCER
NODE PORT ONLY LETS ONE NODE TO TRAFFIC
LOAD BALANCER = TRAFFIC IS REDIRECTING TO NODE WITHOUT CONGESTION

INGRESS ALLOWS TO TRAFFIC FROM API POD TO DB POD. WE DONT NEED TO POLICY FOR THE RESUKT TO GO BACK TO
API POD. ONES YOU ALLOWS TO TRAFFIC THE RESPONSE OR REPLY TO THAT TRAFFIC IS ALLOWED BACK AUTOMATICALLY.
THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT THE DB POD WILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE API POD OR MAKE CALLS TO THE API.
BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY INGRESS ROLE TO DB FROM API POD. IF DB NEEDS TO CONNECT TO API POD THAT NEEDS TO
CREATE EGRESS ROLE FOR DB POD
